"""Anki flashcard tools for spaced repetition. Direct sqlite and AnkiWeb sync, with no Anki app needed.

fastanki reads and writes Anki's collection format and speaks the AnkiWeb sync protocol
directly in Python. Cards live in a local sqlite file and reach desktop/phone via AnkiWeb
sync, and so do media files added with `add_media`.

Importing this module also calls `allow({'fastanki.*': ...})`, so effect-gating sandboxes
built on the pyskills registry (such as safepyrun) trust fastanki's own operations.

## Workflow

- `add_fb_card(Front='...', Back='...')` — create a Basic card (use `deck=`, `tags=`, `model=` to customize)
- `add_card(model='...', deck='...', tags='...', fields={'Field name': '...', 'Field name': '...', 'Field name': '...'})` - create a card using a specific note type (`model=`) using that note type's custom field names
- `find_cards(deck='Math')` / `find_notes(deck='Math')` — search by deck, tag, field substring, or due status
- `get_note(id)` — retrieve a single note by ID
- `update_fb_note(id, Front='...')` — modify fields; `add_tags='tag'` adds tags without replacing
- `del_note(notes=id)` — delete by note ID
- `add_media(path)` — copy an image/sound into the collection; cite the returned name in a field as `<img src="name">` or `[sound:name]`
- `sync()` — push/pull to AnkiWeb, media included (pass `user=`/`passw=` the first time; credentials are cached)

## Flashcard principles for mathematics

1. Understand before you memorize — only card things you've already worked through.
2. One fact per card — split complex topics into atomic Q&A pairs.
3. Test both directions — for key relationships, card formula→name and name→formula.
4. Include worked examples — card the *steps* of a representative problem, not just the result.
5. Combat interference — when two formulas look alike, make dedicated cards highlighting the difference.
6. Connect to the big picture — periodically create summary cards that anchor facts to structure.
7. Card the "why," not just the "what" — ask for the reasoning behind a rule, not only the bare fact.
8. Card derivation steps separately — break multi-step derivations into a chain of step-cards.

## Example: creating precalculus cards

For each concept, create a theory card (what something is) and an applied
card (a specific example). Keep cards short — if a derivation has many steps,
split it into separate cards or focus on the key insight. Show the student
your proposed cards and let them approve before adding.

### Distributive property — theory + applied

    # Student: I like them! Please add :)
    add_fb_card(
        Front='What is the distributive property?',
        Back='\\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\)<br><br>Multiplying something by a sum equals multiplying by each term separately, then adding.'
    )
    add_fb_card(
        Front='Expand using the distributive property: \\(5(x + 3)\\)',
        Back='\\(5x + 15\\)'
    )

### Minus times minus — break down long cards

A first draft was too long (full derivation in one card). The student asked to
break it down. We focused on the key insight, then swapped front/back so the
question asks what the working proves:

    # Student: Can we break down the theory one a bit? Feels like too many steps!
    # Student: Let's switch the front and back around.
    # Student: Perfecto!
    add_fb_card(
        Front='What does this prove, and how?<br>\\(0 = (-1)(0) = (-1)(-1 + 1)\\)<br>Distributing: \\((-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) = 0\\)',
        Back='Proves that \\((-1)(-1) = 1\\) (minus times minus is plus), using the distributive property.'
    )

### Fraction rules — one fact per card

The student corrected a proposal to combine two rules into one card:

    # Student: No that would break our rule! :D Two cards, please
    add_fb_card(
        Front='Intuitive Fraction Rule 1: What does \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) equal?',
        Back='\\(a\\left(\\frac{1}{b}\\right)\\)<br><br>(A fraction is the numerator times one over the denominator)'
    )
    add_fb_card(
        Front='Intuitive Fraction Rule 2: What does \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{b}\\right)\\) equal?',
        Back='\\(\\frac{1}{ab}\\)<br><br>(A third of a tenth is a thirtieth)'
    )

### Exponent rule — theory + applied

    # Student: Can you suggest cards for Exponent Rule 4?
    add_fb_card(
        Front='\\((xy)^n = \\) ?',
        Back='\\(x^n y^n\\)'
    )
    add_fb_card(
        Front='Simplify: \\((2x)^3\\)',
        Back='\\(8x^3\\)'
    )
